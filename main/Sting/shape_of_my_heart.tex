\beginsong{Shape of my heart}[by={Sting},
                     index={He deals the cards as}]
\beginverse

He deals the cards as a meditation
And those he plays never suspect
He doesn't play for the money he wins
He don't play for respect

\endverse
\beginverse

He deals the cards to find the answer
The sacred geometry of chance
The hidden law of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance

\endverse
\beginverse

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

\endverse
\beginverse

He may play the jack of diamonds
He may lay the queen of spades
He may conceal a king in his hand
While the memory of it fades

\endverse
\beginverse

I know that the spades...

\endverse
\beginverse

If I told her that I loved you
You'd maybe think there's something wrong
I'm not a man of too many faces
The mask I wear is one

\endverse
\beginverse

But those who speak know nothing
And find out to their cost
Like those who curse their luck in too many places
And those who fear are lost

\endverse
\beginverse

I know that the spades...
